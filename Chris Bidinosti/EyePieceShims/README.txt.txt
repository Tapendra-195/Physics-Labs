Description: Split cylindrical shim set used to adapt a small-diameter round eyepiece for mounting inside an oversized lens tube slip ring, providing concentric alignment and radial spacing.

Design Decisions:
Used split cylinder instead of using one piece to reduce fatigue and extend the life of the 3d printed part. Added the flange to make it easy to assemble.

Assembly instructions:
1) Loosen the screw on the slip ring.
2) Hold the slip ring horizontally and insert both halves of the split cylinder into the slip ring, with the flange facing outward.
3) Insert the eyepiece between the two split cylinder halves.
4) While keeping the slip ring horizontal, tighten the screw to secure the assembly.
