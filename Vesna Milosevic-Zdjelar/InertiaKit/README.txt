Description: Exploration of Newton's First Law: Inertia Kit from Arbor Scientific. 3D modeled because it is a lot cheaper to.

Design Decisions:
Added a cut on the outer track so that the inner track can be pushed out as they are same size. Printed in white color to make it easy to see/project with the camera.

Assembly instructions:
1) Insert the solid track inside the hollow one keeping the beveled side up and flat side down.
2) The solid track can be pushed out to make the track longer.
